            deactivated for sure.. Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of grease! Now come out
            before somebody sees you. Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm not getting in there!
            I'm going to regret this. There goes another one. Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been
            short-circuited. That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here. Are you sure this things safe?
            Close up formation. You'd better let her loose. Almost there! I can't hold them! It's away! It's a hit!

            tear this ship apart until you've found those plans and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive! There she
            is! Set for stun! She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner. What a piece of junk. She'Il
            make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not look like much, but she's got it where it counts,
            kid. I've added some special modifications myself. We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll
            get out of here. Hello, sir.
